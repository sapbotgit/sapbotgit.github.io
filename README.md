# OpenArchive

OpenArchive is a archive of random software.

If you here for surfing a games open github [repository](https://github.com/sapbotgit/sapbotgit.github.io/). Also if you want to download romarchive.zapto.org's file but original host is down, this is fully compatible with it.

If you don't like your software to be there, open new issue, and I will delete it.
If you WANT your software there, open pull request with your software added to correct folder. Syntax described [here](https://sapbotgit.github.io/public/filenamesyntax.html).
