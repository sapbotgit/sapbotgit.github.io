# OpenArchive

OpenArchive is a github-friendly mirror of Romarchive containing user contributed and public domain projects.

If you here for surfing a games open github [repository](https://github.com/sapbotgit/sapbotgit.github.io/). Also if you want to download romarchive.zapto.org's file but original host is down, this is fully compatible with it.

If you don't like your software to be there, open new issue, and I will delete it.
